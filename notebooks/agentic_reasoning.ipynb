It offers a context window of 10 million tokens. Maverick is larger than Scout and supposedly matches the performance of OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in coding and reasoning tasks while utilizing fewer active parameters.\\n\\nThe largest of the three, Behemoth, boasts 288 billion active parameters and a total of 2 trillion parameters, with Meta claiming that it surpasses models like GPT-4.5 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 on STEM benchmarks.\\n\\nShortly after the release, rumors began to spread that Meta had trained Maverick and Llama 4 on test sets, causing them to rank higher in benchmarks. The rumor was reportedly started by a supposed Meta whistleblower on a Chinese website who resigned after making the following post (translated):\\n\\nAfter repeated training, the performance of the internal model still fails to reach open-source SOTA levels, and is even far behind them. Company leadership suggested mixing various benchmark test sets into the post-training process, aiming to produce a result that “looks okay” across multiple metrics. If the set deadline at the end of April isn’t met, they may stop further investment.\\n\\nAfter Llama 4 was released yesterday, there were already many poor real-world performance results shared on X (Twitter) and Reddit. As someone who’s currently also active in academia, I find this practice unacceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, I’ve submitted my resignation request and have explicitly asked that my name not be included in Llama 4’s Technical Report. I’ve also heard that Meta’s VP of AI resigned for the same reason.\\n\\nThis rumor quickly spread to X and Reddit, now prompting a response from Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, who denied the allegations, stating that they were \"simply not true\" and Meta \"would never do that.\"\\n\\nThe rumor sounded believable, in no small part due to the multiple reports on X of different behaviors between the version of Maverick publicly available to developers and the version Meta showcased on LMArena.\\n\\nThe Llama 4 model that won in LM Arena is different than the released version. I have been comparing the answers from Arena to the released model. They aren\\'t close.\\nThe data is worth a look also as it shows how LM Arena results can be manipulated to be more pleasing to humans. https://t.co/7yCd3CiJ42 pic.twitter.com/A6Yirn04g7\\n\\nAlso, Meta itself acknowledged that the Maverick hosted on LMArena was an \"experimental chat version\":\\n\\nLlama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena.\\n\\nAl-Dahle provided an explanation for the \"mixed quality\" that has been reported across different services, stating that since the models dropped as soon as they were ready, it will take several days for all the public implementations to get \"dialed in.\"\\n\\nTags\\n\\nThanks to the Trump tariffs, Framework has paused US sales of some laptops\\n\\nWindows 11 build 22635.5170 is out in Beta Channel with File Explorer improvements and more\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nMeta launches Llama 4, advanced multi-modal LLMs achieving SOTA results\\n\\nPradeep Viswanathan\\n                                                ·\\n                    \\nApr 6, 2025\\n\\nwith\\n6\\n                            comment\\n                                s\\n\\nFoxconn unveils its own large language model distilled from Meta\\'s Llama 3.1\\n\\nKarthik Mudaliar\\n                                                ·\\n                    \\nMar 10, 2025\\n\\nwith\\n0\\n                            comment\\n                                s\\n\\nLeaked emails allegedly reveal Meta torrented terabytes of pirated ebooks for AI training\\n\\nOmer Dursun\\n                                                ·\\n                    \\nFeb 8, 2025\\n\\nwith\\n20\\n                            comment\\n                                s\\n\\nMeta plans to spend $65 billion on AI investments, amid DeepSeek superiority claims\\n\\nKarthik Mudaliar\\n                                                ·\\n                    \\nJan 24, 2025\\n\\nwith\\n8\\n                            comment\\n                                s\\n\\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\\n\\nCommunity Activity\\n\\nSoftware Stories\\n\\nWebSite-Watcher 2025 (25.2)\\n\\nBitdefender Antivirus Free 27.0.49.254\\n\\nFirefox 137.0.1\\n\\nAIDA64 7.65.7400\\n\\nTrending Stories\\n\\nWindows 11 build 22635.5170 is out in Beta Channel with File Explorer improvements and more\\n\\nLegendary Apple designer Jony Ive is reportedly working on a screenless AI phone\\n\\nChina\\'s new USB-C and B compatible GPMI said to blow HDMI and DisplayPort away\\n\\nSanDisk 2TB Extreme microSD card is now available at its lowest price\\n\\nJoin the conversation!\\n\\nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\\n\\n1 Comment - Add comment\\n\\nReport Comment\\n\\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\\n\\nSouth of Midnight: A must-play gorgeous platformer from Xbox\\n\\nsouth of midnight\\n\\nLincStation N2: Next-gen all-SSD 10GbE NAS for just $309?

AI benchmark optimization creates a credibility gap in the industry\\nThe controversy around Meta’s AI benchmarking reveals a persistent challenge in the industry: benchmark scores often fail to reflect real-world capabilities.\\nWhen Google’s Gemini model topped a crucial AI benchmark with a score of 1344, surpassing OpenAI’s GPT-4o, researchers discovered its performance plummeted when controlling for simple factors like response formatting 1.\\nThis pattern of benchmark optimization has created what experts call a “crisis in AI evaluation,” where companies optimize for leaderboard rankings rather than genuine improvements in reasoning and reliability 1.\\nThe gap between benchmark performance and practical utility is further illustrated by the ARC-AGI-2 test, where leading models from OpenAI and Google scored dismally at 4% and 1.3% respectively on reasoning tasks, despite impressive results on standard benchmarks 2.\\nThese discrepancies highlight why Meta’s benchmark controversy resonates within the AI community, as the industry’s reliance on potentially manipulable metrics undermines trust in reported AI capabilities.\\nB. The evolution of AI evaluation reflects growing industry maturity\\nThe Meta benchmark controversy is part of a broader shift toward more comprehensive and meaningful AI evaluation methods as the field matures.\\nStanford researchers recently developed new benchmarks specifically designed to measure AI bias and understanding more effectively, arguing that existing fairness benchmarks often yield misleading results as models can score well without demonstrating true fairness 3.\\nThe AI industry is increasingly recognizing that effective benchmarks must address unique challenges posed by AI systems, including reproducibility, bias mitigation, and real-world applicability 4.\\nAs enterprises integrate AI into business operations, the focus is shifting from narrow technical metrics to evaluation frameworks that correlate with business outcomes and consider ethical implications 5.\\nMeta’s current predicament reflects the industry’s growing pains as it transitions from an era of headline-grabbing benchmark results to more nuanced, meaningful measurements of AI capability and reliability.\\nRecent Meta developments\\n| Timeline |\\n| --- |\\n| 06-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\n*   Meta launches Llama 4 AI models, Scout and Maverick.\\n*   Models support 200+ languages, debut at LlamaCon.\\n|\\n| 06-Apr-2025 📉 Meta’s content moderation contractor said to cut 2,000 jobs\\n\\nTelus lays off 2,000 after Meta ends contract.\\nEmployees on gardening leave as severance terms negotiated.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 🏢 Meta plans $837m data center in US state for AI push\\n\\nMeta to invest $1B in Wisconsin data center.\\nProject aims to enhance AI and cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 📰 Meta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7\\n\\nMeta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7.\\nUser-driven model to replace content moderation.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🔍 Meta under US Senate review for alleged China market efforts\\n\\nSenate probes Meta’s China market access efforts.\\nDocuments on Project Aldrin and censorship sought.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta’s AI research head to step down in May\\n\\nJoelle Pineau to leave Meta in May 2025.\\nFAIR advanced AI tech under her leadership.\\n\\n|\\n👀 See Also: Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\nHow would you feel if you could no longer use Tech in Asia?\\n😥\\nVery disappointed\\n🙁\\nSomewhat disappointed\\n🤷\\u200d♀️\\nNot disappointed (it isn’t that useful)\\n😐\\nN/A - I don’t use TIA much anymore\\nRecommended reads\\n\\n Weekly funding: India-based Spinny raises $131m 1 min read\\n Why regulators said yes to Grab’s Singapore taxi play 5 min read\\n The practical lessons in Grab’s AI marketing playbook 5 min read\\n Asia layoff tracker: AI shift triggers layoffs at Zomato 2 min read\\n The 3-minute shows making billions 4 min read\\n A super angel’s guide to being on the better side of fundraising 6 min read\\n How startups can make chatbots more than a digital dead end 5 min read\\n China’s hooked on microdramas.

In a post on X, Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of GenAI, said, _“_We’ve also heard claims that we trained on test sets — that’s simply not true, and we would never do that.” He added that the company released the models as soon as they were ready and that “it’ll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in.” Meta attributed the mixed performance reports to implementation stability rather than flaws in the training process.\\n\\nMeta recently launched two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverik.\\nMaverick quickly reached the second spot on LMArena, the AI benchmark platform where users vote on the best responses in head-to-head model comparisons. In its press release, Meta pointed to Maverick’s ELO score of 1417, ranking it above OpenAI’s GPT-4o and just below Gemini 2.5 Pro.\\nHowever, the version of Maverick evaluated on LMArena isn’t identical to what Meta has made publicly available. In its blog post, Meta said that it used an “experimental chat version” tailored to improve “conversationality.”\\nChatbot Arena, run by lmarena.ai (formerly lmsys.org), acknowledged community concerns and shared over 2,000 head-to-head battle results for review. “To ensure full transparency, we’re releasing 2,000+ head-to-head battle results for public review. This includes user prompts, model responses, and user preferences,” the company said.\\nThey also said Meta’s interpretation of Arena’s policies did not align with expectations, prompting a leaderboard policy update to ensure fair and reproducible future evaluations.\\n“In addition, we’re also adding the HF version of Llama-4-Maverick to Arena, with leaderboard results published shortly. Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers. Meta should have made it clearer that “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental” was a customised model to optimise for human preference,” the company said.\\nThe drama around Llama 4 benchmarks started when a now-viral Reddit post citing a Chinese report , allegedly from a Meta employee involved in Llama 4’s development, claiming internal pressure to blend benchmark test sets during post-training.\\n“Company leadership suggested blending test sets from various benchmarks during the post-training process, aiming to meet the targets across various metrics,” the post read. In the report, the employee wrote that they had submitted their resignation and requested to be excluded from the technical report.\\nAIM reached out to Meta sources and confirmed that the employee has not left the company, and the Chinese post is fake.\\nHowever, several AI researchers have noted a difference between the benchmarks reported by Meta and the ones they observed. “Llama 4 on LMSys is a totally different style than Llama 4 elsewhere, even if you use the recommended system prompt. Tried various prompts myself,” said a user on X.\\n“4D chess move: use Llama 4 experimental to hack LMSys, expose the slop preference, and finally discredit the entire ranking system,” quipped Susan Zhang, senior staff research engineer at Google DeepMind.\\nQuestions were also raised about the weekend release of Llama 4, as tech giants usually make announcements on weekdays. It is also said that Meta was under pressure to release Llama 4 before DeepSeek launches its next reasoning model, R2. Meanwhile, Meta has announced that it will release its reasoning model soon.\\nBefore the release of Llama 4, The Information had reported that Meta had pushed back the release date at least twice, as the model didn’t perform as well on technical benchmarks as hoped—particularly in reasoning and math tasks. Meta has also had concerns that Llama 4 is less capable than OpenAI’s models at conducting humanlike voice conversations.\\n📣 Be a part of India’s leading AI summit—register for Cypher today!!\\n📣 Want to advertise in AIM?

It offers a context window of 10 million tokens. Maverick is larger than Scout and supposedly matches the performance of OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in coding and reasoning tasks while utilizing fewer active parameters.\\n\\nThe largest of the three, Behemoth, boasts 288 billion active parameters and a total of 2 trillion parameters, with Meta claiming that it surpasses models like GPT-4.5 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 on STEM benchmarks.\\n\\nShortly after the release, rumors began to spread that Meta had trained Maverick and Llama 4 on test sets, causing them to rank higher in benchmarks. The rumor was reportedly started by a supposed Meta whistleblower on a Chinese website who resigned after making the following post (translated):\\n\\nAfter repeated training, the performance of the internal model still fails to reach open-source SOTA levels, and is even far behind them. Company leadership suggested mixing various benchmark test sets into the post-training process, aiming to produce a result that “looks okay” across multiple metrics. If the set deadline at the end of April isn’t met, they may stop further investment.\\n\\nAfter Llama 4 was released yesterday, there were already many poor real-world performance results shared on X (Twitter) and Reddit. As someone who’s currently also active in academia, I find this practice unacceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, I’ve submitted my resignation request and have explicitly asked that my name not be included in Llama 4’s Technical Report. I’ve also heard that Meta’s VP of AI resigned for the same reason.\\n\\nThis rumor quickly spread to X and Reddit, now prompting a response from Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, who denied the allegations, stating that they were \"simply not true\" and Meta \"would never do that.\"\\n\\nThe rumor sounded believable, in no small part due to the multiple reports on X of different behaviors between the version of Maverick publicly available to developers and the version Meta showcased on LMArena.\\n\\nThe Llama 4 model that won in LM Arena is different than the released version.

AI benchmark optimization creates a credibility gap in the industry\\nThe controversy around Meta’s AI benchmarking reveals a persistent challenge in the industry: benchmark scores often fail to reflect real-world capabilities.\\nWhen Google’s Gemini model topped a crucial AI benchmark with a score of 1344, surpassing OpenAI’s GPT-4o, researchers discovered its performance plummeted when controlling for simple factors like response formatting 1.\\nThis pattern of benchmark optimization has created what experts call a “crisis in AI evaluation,” where companies optimize for leaderboard rankings rather than genuine improvements in reasoning and reliability 1.\\nThe gap between benchmark performance and practical utility is further illustrated by the ARC-AGI-2 test, where leading models from OpenAI and Google scored dismally at 4% and 1.3% respectively on reasoning tasks, despite impressive results on standard benchmarks 2.\\nThese discrepancies highlight why Meta’s benchmark controversy resonates within the AI community, as the industry’s reliance on potentially manipulable metrics undermines trust in reported AI capabilities.\\nB. The evolution of AI evaluation reflects growing industry maturity\\nThe Meta benchmark controversy is part of a broader shift toward more comprehensive and meaningful AI evaluation methods as the field matures.\\nStanford researchers recently developed new benchmarks specifically designed to measure AI bias and understanding more effectively, arguing that existing fairness benchmarks often yield misleading results as models can score well without demonstrating true fairness 3.\\nThe AI industry is increasingly recognizing that effective benchmarks must address unique challenges posed by AI systems, including reproducibility, bias mitigation, and real-world applicability 4.\\nAs enterprises integrate AI into business operations, the focus is shifting from narrow technical metrics to evaluation frameworks that correlate with business outcomes and consider ethical implications 5.\\nMeta’s current predicament reflects the industry’s growing pains as it transitions from an era of headline-grabbing benchmark results to more nuanced, meaningful measurements of AI capability and reliability.\\nRecent Meta developments\\n| Timeline |\\n| --- |\\n| 06-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\n*   Meta launches Llama 4 AI models, Scout and Maverick.\\n*   Models support 200+ languages, debut at LlamaCon.\\n|\\n| 06-Apr-2025 📉 Meta’s content moderation contractor said to cut 2,000 jobs\\n\\nTelus lays off 2,000 after Meta ends contract.\\nEmployees on gardening leave as severance terms negotiated.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 🏢 Meta plans $837m data center in US state for AI push\\n\\nMeta to invest $1B in Wisconsin data center.\\nProject aims to enhance AI and cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 📰 Meta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7\\n\\nMeta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7.\\nUser-driven model to replace content moderation.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🔍 Meta under US Senate review for alleged China market efforts\\n\\nSenate probes Meta’s China market access efforts.\\nDocuments on Project Aldrin and censorship sought.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta’s AI research head to step down in May\\n\\nJoelle Pineau to leave Meta in May 2025.\\nFAIR advanced AI tech under her leadership.\\n\\n|\\n👀 See Also: Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\nHow would you feel if you could no longer use Tech in Asia?\\n😥\\nVery disappointed\\n🙁\\nSomewhat disappointed\\n🤷\\u200d♀️\\nNot disappointed (it isn’t that useful)\\n😐\\nN/A - I don’t use TIA much anymore\\nRecommended reads\\n\\n Weekly funding: India-based Spinny raises $131m 1 min read\\n Why regulators said yes to Grab’s Singapore taxi play 5 min read\\n The practical lessons in Grab’s AI marketing playbook 5 min read\\n Asia layoff tracker: AI shift triggers layoffs at Zomato 2 min read\\n The 3-minute shows making billions 4 min read\\n A super angel’s guide to being on the better side of fundraising 6 min read\\n How startups can make chatbots more than a digital dead end 5 min read\\n China’s hooked on microdramas.

In a post on X, Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of GenAI, said, _“_We’ve also heard claims that we trained on test sets — that’s simply not true, and we would never do that.” He added that the company released the models as soon as they were ready and that “it’ll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in.” Meta attributed the mixed performance reports to implementation stability rather than flaws in the training process.\\n\\nMeta recently launched two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverik.\\nMaverick quickly reached the second spot on LMArena, the AI benchmark platform where users vote on the best responses in head-to-head model comparisons. In its press release, Meta pointed to Maverick’s ELO score of 1417, ranking it above OpenAI’s GPT-4o and just below Gemini 2.5 Pro.\\nHowever, the version of Maverick evaluated on LMArena isn’t identical to what Meta has made publicly available. In its blog post, Meta said that it used an “experimental chat version” tailored to improve “conversationality.”\\nChatbot Arena, run by lmarena.ai (formerly lmsys.org), acknowledged community concerns and shared over 2,000 head-to-head battle results for review. “To ensure full transparency, we’re releasing 2,000+ head-to-head battle results for public review. This includes user prompts, model responses, and user preferences,” the company said.\\nThey also said Meta’s interpretation of Arena’s policies did not align with expectations, prompting a leaderboard policy update to ensure fair and reproducible future evaluations.\\n“In addition, we’re also adding the HF version of Llama-4-Maverick to Arena, with leaderboard results published shortly. Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers. Meta should have made it clearer that “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental” was a customised model to optimise for human preference,” the company said.\\nThe drama around Llama 4 benchmarks started when a now-viral Reddit post citing a Chinese report , allegedly from a Meta employee involved in Llama 4’s development, claiming internal pressure to blend benchmark test sets during post-training.\\n“Company leadership suggested blending test sets from various benchmarks during the post-training process, aiming to meet the targets across various metrics,” the post read. In the report, the employee wrote that they had submitted their resignation and requested to be excluded from the technical report.\\nAIM reached out to Meta sources and confirmed that the employee has not left the company, and the Chinese post is fake.\\nHowever, several AI researchers have noted a difference between the benchmarks reported by Meta and the ones they observed. “Llama 4 on LMSys is a totally different style than Llama 4 elsewhere, even if you use the recommended system prompt. Tried various prompts myself,” said a user on X.\\n“4D chess move: use Llama 4 experimental to hack LMSys, expose the slop preference, and finally discredit the entire ranking system,” quipped Susan Zhang, senior staff research engineer at Google DeepMind.\\nQuestions were also raised about the weekend release of Llama 4, as tech giants usually make announcements on weekdays. It is also said that Meta was under pressure to release Llama 4 before DeepSeek launches its next reasoning model, R2. Meanwhile, Meta has announced that it will release its reasoning model soon.\\nBefore the release of Llama 4, The Information had reported that Meta had pushed back the release date at least twice, as the model didn’t perform as well on technical benchmarks as hoped—particularly in reasoning and math tasks. Meta has also had concerns that Llama 4 is less capable than OpenAI’s models at conducting humanlike voice conversations.\\n📣 Be a part of India’s leading AI summit—register for Cypher today!!\\n📣 Want to advertise in AIM?

It offers a context window of 10 million tokens. Maverick is larger than Scout and supposedly matches the performance of OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in coding and reasoning tasks while utilizing fewer active parameters.\\n\\nThe largest of the three, Behemoth, boasts 288 billion active parameters and a total of 2 trillion parameters, with Meta claiming that it surpasses models like GPT-4.5 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 on STEM benchmarks.\\n\\nShortly after the release, rumors began to spread that Meta had trained Maverick and Llama 4 on test sets, causing them to rank higher in benchmarks. The rumor was reportedly started by a supposed Meta whistleblower on a Chinese website who resigned after making the following post (translated):\\n\\nAfter repeated training, the performance of the internal model still fails to reach open-source SOTA levels, and is even far behind them. Company leadership suggested mixing various benchmark test sets into the post-training process, aiming to produce a result that “looks okay” across multiple metrics. If the set deadline at the end of April isn’t met, they may stop further investment.\\n\\nAfter Llama 4 was released yesterday, there were already many poor real-world performance results shared on X (Twitter) and Reddit. As someone who’s currently also active in academia, I find this practice unacceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, I’ve submitted my resignation request and have explicitly asked that my name not be included in Llama 4’s Technical Report. I’ve also heard that Meta’s VP of AI resigned for the same reason.\\n\\nThis rumor quickly spread to X and Reddit, now prompting a response from Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, who denied the allegations, stating that they were \"simply not true\" and Meta \"would never do that.\"\\n\\nThe rumor sounded believable, in no small part due to the multiple reports on X of different behaviors between the version of Maverick publicly available to developers and the version Meta showcased on LMArena.\\n\\nThe Llama 4 model that won in LM Arena is different than the released version. I have been comparing the answers from Arena to the released model.

AI benchmark optimization creates a credibility gap in the industry\\nThe controversy around Meta’s AI benchmarking reveals a persistent challenge in the industry: benchmark scores often fail to reflect real-world capabilities.\\nWhen Google’s Gemini model topped a crucial AI benchmark with a score of 1344, surpassing OpenAI’s GPT-4o, researchers discovered its performance plummeted when controlling for simple factors like response formatting 1.\\nThis pattern of benchmark optimization has created what experts call a “crisis in AI evaluation,” where companies optimize for leaderboard rankings rather than genuine improvements in reasoning and reliability 1.\\nThe gap between benchmark performance and practical utility is further illustrated by the ARC-AGI-2 test, where leading models from OpenAI and Google scored dismally at 4% and 1.3% respectively on reasoning tasks, despite impressive results on standard benchmarks 2.\\nThese discrepancies highlight why Meta’s benchmark controversy resonates within the AI community, as the industry’s reliance on potentially manipulable metrics undermines trust in reported AI capabilities.\\nB. The evolution of AI evaluation reflects growing industry maturity\\nThe Meta benchmark controversy is part of a broader shift toward more comprehensive and meaningful AI evaluation methods as the field matures.\\nStanford researchers recently developed new benchmarks specifically designed to measure AI bias and understanding more effectively, arguing that existing fairness benchmarks often yield misleading results as models can score well without demonstrating true fairness 3.\\nThe AI industry is increasingly recognizing that effective benchmarks must address unique challenges posed by AI systems, including reproducibility, bias mitigation, and real-world applicability 4.\\nAs enterprises integrate AI into business operations, the focus is shifting from narrow technical metrics to evaluation frameworks that correlate with business outcomes and consider ethical implications 5.\\nMeta’s current predicament reflects the industry’s growing pains as it transitions from an era of headline-grabbing benchmark results to more nuanced, meaningful measurements of AI capability and reliability.\\nRecent Meta developments\\n| Timeline |\\n| --- |\\n| 06-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\n*   Meta launches Llama 4 AI models, Scout and Maverick.\\n*   Models support 200+ languages, debut at LlamaCon.\\n|\\n| 06-Apr-2025 📉 Meta’s content moderation contractor said to cut 2,000 jobs\\n\\nTelus lays off 2,000 after Meta ends contract.\\nEmployees on gardening leave as severance terms negotiated.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 🏢 Meta plans $837m data center in US state for AI push\\n\\nMeta to invest $1B in Wisconsin data center.\\nProject aims to enhance AI and cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n|\\n| 05-Apr-2025 📰 Meta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7\\n\\nMeta ends US fact-checking on Apr. 7.\\nUser-driven model to replace content moderation.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🔍 Meta under US Senate review for alleged China market efforts\\n\\nSenate probes Meta’s China market access efforts.\\nDocuments on Project Aldrin and censorship sought.\\n\\n|\\n| 02-Apr-2025 🤖 Meta’s AI research head to step down in May\\n\\nJoelle Pineau to leave Meta in May 2025.\\nFAIR advanced AI tech under her leadership.\\n\\n|\\n👀 See Also: Meta launches new AI models with advanced features\\nHow would you feel if you could no longer use Tech in Asia?\\n😥\\nVery disappointed\\n🙁\\nSomewhat disappointed\\n🤷\\u200d♀️\\nNot disappointed (it isn’t that useful)\\n😐\\nN/A - I don’t use TIA much anymore\\nRecommended reads\\n\\n Weekly funding: India-based Spinny raises $131m 1 min read\\n Why regulators said yes to Grab’s Singapore taxi play 5 min read\\n The practical lessons in Grab’s AI marketing playbook 5 min read\\n Asia layoff tracker: AI shift triggers layoffs at Zomato 2 min read\\n The 3-minute shows making billions 4 min read\\n A super angel’s guide to being on the better side of fundraising 6 min read\\n How startups can make chatbots more than a digital dead end 5 min read\\n China’s hooked on microdramas.

In a post on X, Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of GenAI, said, _“_We’ve also heard claims that we trained on test sets — that’s simply not true, and we would never do that.” He added that the company released the models as soon as they were ready and that “it’ll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in.” Meta attributed the mixed performance reports to implementation stability rather than flaws in the training process.\\n\\nMeta recently launched two new Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverik.\\nMaverick quickly reached the second spot on LMArena, the AI benchmark platform where users vote on the best responses in head-to-head model comparisons. In its press release, Meta pointed to Maverick’s ELO score of 1417, ranking it above OpenAI’s GPT-4o and just below Gemini 2.5 Pro.\\nHowever, the version of Maverick evaluated on LMArena isn’t identical to what Meta has made publicly available. In its blog post, Meta said that it used an “experimental chat version” tailored to improve “conversationality.”\\nChatbot Arena, run by lmarena.ai (formerly lmsys.org), acknowledged community concerns and shared over 2,000 head-to-head battle results for review. “To ensure full transparency, we’re releasing 2,000+ head-to-head battle results for public review. This includes user prompts, model responses, and user preferences,” the company said.\\nThey also said Meta’s interpretation of Arena’s policies did not align with expectations, prompting a leaderboard policy update to ensure fair and reproducible future evaluations.\\n“In addition, we’re also adding the HF version of Llama-4-Maverick to Arena, with leaderboard results published shortly. Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers. Meta should have made it clearer that “Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental” was a customised model to optimise for human preference,” the company said.\\nThe drama around Llama 4 benchmarks started when a now-viral Reddit post citing a Chinese report , allegedly from a Meta employee involved in Llama 4’s development, claiming internal pressure to blend benchmark test sets during post-training.\\n“Company leadership suggested blending test sets from various benchmarks during the post-training process, aiming to meet the targets across various metrics,” the post read. In the report, the employee wrote that they had submitted their resignation and requested to be excluded from the technical report.\\nAIM reached out to Meta sources and confirmed that the employee has not left the company, and the Chinese post is fake.\\nHowever, several AI researchers have noted a difference between the benchmarks reported by Meta and the ones they observed. “Llama 4 on LMSys is a totally different style than Llama 4 elsewhere, even if you use the recommended system prompt. Tried various prompts myself,” said a user on X.\\n“4D chess move: use Llama 4 experimental to hack LMSys, expose the slop preference, and finally discredit the entire ranking system,” quipped Susan Zhang, senior staff research engineer at Google DeepMind.\\nQuestions were also raised about the weekend release of Llama 4, as tech giants usually make announcements on weekdays. It is also said that Meta was under pressure to release Llama 4 before DeepSeek launches its next reasoning model, R2. Meanwhile, Meta has announced that it will release its reasoning model soon.\\nBefore the release of Llama 4, The Information had reported that Meta had pushed back the release date at least twice, as the model didn’t perform as well on technical benchmarks as hoped—particularly in reasoning and math tasks. Meta has also had concerns that Llama 4 is less capable than OpenAI’s models at conducting humanlike voice conversations.\\n📣 Be a part of India’s leading AI summit—register for Cypher today!!\\n📣 Want to advertise in AIM?

Specifically, it was claimed that Meta trained the models on test sets, which is not a standard practice.\\n\\nMeta has denied these allegations, stating that they are \"simply not true\" and that they would never train models on test sets. They attributed the mixed performance reports to implementation stability rather than flaws in the training process.\\n\\nThe controversy highlights a challenge in the AI industry, where benchmark scores often fail to reflect real-world capabilities. Researchers have noted discrepancies between benchmark performance and practical utility, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive and meaningful evaluation methods.\\n\\nHere is some code to assess a model\\'s performance compared to the industry average:\\n\\n```python\\ndef compare_model_performance(model_name, model_score, industry_average_score):\\n    if model_score > industry_average_score:\\n        print(f\"{model_name} outperforms the industry average with a score of {model_score} compared to {industry_average_score}.\")\\n    elif model_score < industry_average_score:\\n        print(f\"{model_name} underperforms the industry average with a score of {model_score} compared to {industry_average_score}.\")\\n    else:\\n        print(f\"{model_name} performs equally to the industry average with a score of {model_score}.\")\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nmodel_name = \"Llama4\"\\nmodel_score = 0.85  # Replace with actual score\\nindustry_average_score = 0.8  # Replace with actual industry average score\\n\\ncompare_model_performance(model_name, model_score, industry_average_score)\\n```\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Llama4 models have achieved impressive benchmark scores, there are concerns about the legitimacy of these results. It is essential to verify information through official channels and consider multiple sources before making a judgment. \\n\\nTherefore, I would advise caution when evaluating information about Llama4, and it is possible that it might be a scam or not a real model. However, based on the latest information available, Llama4 seems to be a legitimate model developed by Meta, but its benchmark scores and performance require further evaluation. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or assistance.'"
