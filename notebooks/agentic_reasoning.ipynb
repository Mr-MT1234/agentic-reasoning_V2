Surprisingly, the real-world performance of Llama 4 Maverick didn’t match benchmark claims from Meta, particularly in coding tasks. In fact, the user claims that the recent resignation of Meta’s Head of AI research, Joelle Pineau, is directly linked to the Llama 4 benchmark hacking.', 'On Saturday, Meta unexpectedly dropped two new Llama models, Scout and Maverick, claiming that Maverick outperformed GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash and achieved comparable results to the new DeepSeek', 'Meta Executive Denies Llama 4 Benchmark Manipulation Claims - Technology Org Science & technology news Science & technology news Science & technology news Science and Technology Spotlight News Physics news Technologies news Meta Executive Refutes Claims of Benchmark Manipulation for Llama 4 Models Meta’s generative AI chief firmly denied accusations that the company artificially enhanced benchmark scores for its newest AI models.
